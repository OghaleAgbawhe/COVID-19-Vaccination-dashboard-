This dashboard was created utilizing COVID vaccination data. The main focus of the project was to understand the impact of a country's GDP on the vaccination count, as well as to analyze the percentage of the world's population that is fully or partially vaccinated. The dashboard features various interactive visualizations such as choropleth maps and trend line charts. These visualizations allow users to explore the data dynamically and gain insights into the vaccination progress across different countries and continents. Additionally, the dashboard provides the flexibility to filter the data based on specific continents and countries, enabling users to examine vaccination trends at a more granular level.
